## Ledger & Salaries

For a society to be able to be registered, the job must be inserted into `society` database table, otherwise Ledger and Salary System in general, won't be functional, even if the option is enabled from the configuration file.

(!) A society will be registered only after the script is restarted and not while server is running.
